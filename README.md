# Health-Care-Analysis
DESCRIPTION:
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. It is therefore necessary to identify the causes and develop a system to predict heart attacks in an effective manner. The data below has the information about the factors that might have an impact on cardiovascular health. 
Here we have the description of the features:
age - age in years
sex - sex (0 = female; 1 = male)
cp - chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 0 = asymptomatic)
trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol - serum cholesterol in mg/dl
fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (0 = false; 1 = true)
restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = hypertrophy; 2 = having ST-T wave abnormality)
thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
exang - exercise induced angina (0 = no; 1 = yes)
oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = down sloping; 1 = flat; 2 = upsloping)
ca - number of major vessels (0-4) colored by fluoroscopy
thal - thallium stress test (1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect; 3 = normal)
target - 0 = less chance of heart attack; 1 = more chance of heart attack



Below Tasks are Performed:
1.	Importing necessary libraries
2.	Read the dataset
3.	Data cleaning
a.	Check for duplicate values
b.	Check for Null values
c.	Check for Outliers
4.	EDA-Visualisation
a. Univariate analysis
b. Bivariate analysis
   5. Feature Scaling
   6. Data Preparation
   7. Model Building
      a. Logistic Regression
      b. Random Forest
      c. Hyperparameter Tunning 
  8. Evaluation

CONCLUSION:
               We have got more than 80% of accuracy score in both Logistic regression and Random forest.
